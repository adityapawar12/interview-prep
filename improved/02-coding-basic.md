### 1. Difference between Frontend and Backend

- **Frontend:** The frontend is the part of the application that users interact with directly. It includes visual elements such as buttons, checkboxes, graphics, and text. The frontend is responsible for the layout, design, and overall user experience of the application. It is developed using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend:** The backend is the server-side of the application that handles data processing, storage, and business logic. It manages the data exchange between the server and the client, and it ensures that the application functions correctly. The backend is developed using languages and frameworks like Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, and involves databases such as SQL or NoSQL systems.
- **Interaction:** The frontend communicates with the backend through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to fetch or send data, ensuring that the user interface reflects the current state of the application.

### Difference Between Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication** is the method of verifying the identity of a consumer or system to ensure they’re who they claim to be.

  - It involves checking credentials such as usernames and passwords.
  - This step is vital for securing access to systems, programs, and sensitive records.
  - By confirming identities, authentication protects against unauthorized entry and safety breaches.

- **Authorization** is the method of figuring out and granting permissions to a demonstrated user or system.
  - It specifies what assets they can access and what actions they’re allowed to carry out.
  - It comes after authentication and ensures that the authenticated entity has the proper rights to use certain data, applications, or services.
  - This step is important for implementing protection guidelines and controlling access within the system, thereby preventing unauthorized activities.
