### About Me

I’m Aditya Pandurang Pawar, a 24-year-old software developer based in Mumbai with a Bachelor of Science degree from P.V.G. College of Science and Technology.

My most recent experience was as a Full Stack Developer at Tikao, where I played a key role in developing a SaaS platform aimed at assessing and enhancing brand sustainability scores. I focused primarily on frontend development, collaborating with graphic designers to deliver an engaging UI/UX, and working closely with our project manager to implement complex functionalities. This project leveraged **Next.js** on the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

Prior to Tikao, I contributed to the development of **CALLR** at Prausam, a Customer-to-Business video interaction platform. I began as a Frontend Developer using **Angular 10** and expanded my skills to include backend services with **SQL Server**, **MongoDB**, and **Node.js**.

I’m deeply passionate about software development and eager to embrace new challenges. I look forward to further refining my expertise and contributing to cutting-edge projects in this dynamic field.
