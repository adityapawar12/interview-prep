### 1. What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source, asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side.
- It enables JavaScript to run outside of the browser, making it a powerful tool for server-side scripting. Node.js is widely used in web development and comes with a variety of built-in modules.
- With Node.js, you can perform tasks such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files on the server, collecting form data, and interacting with databases to add, create, modify, or delete data.

### 2. Difference between JavaScript and Node.js

- **JavaScript** is a high-level programming language commonly used for client-side web development, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side, enabling the development of scalable and efficient server-side applications.

- JavaScript can run in any web browser that has a JavaScript engine.
- **Node.js** uses the **V8 JavaScript engine** (the same engine used by Chrome) to execute JavaScript outside of a browser environment.

- Traditionally, JavaScript was confined to running within the browser.
- With **Node.js**, JavaScript can now be run on the server, allowing for the development of full-stack applications using a single programming language.

### 3. Benefits of Node.js

- **Cross-Platform & Open Source:** Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side development.
- **Asynchronous & Scalable:** Node.js is designed for asynchronous programming, which makes it highly efficient and scalable, particularly for handling multiple concurrent connections. This non-blocking I/O model is ideal for building real-time applications like chat servers or streaming services.
- **Efficient Execution:** Node.js is single-threaded and built on the **V8 JavaScript engine** from Chrome. It compiles JavaScript into machine code, ensuring fast and efficient execution of code.
- **Large Ecosystem:** Node.js has a rich ecosystem with a vast number of packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), enabling developers to quickly add functionality and build applications faster.

### 4. What is Middleware?

- Middleware is a request handler that allows you to intercept and manipulate requests and responses before they reach route handlers.
- They are the functions that are invoked by the Express.js routing layer.
- These are functions that have access to the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle.
- It is a flexible tool that helps in adding functionalities like logging, authentication, error handling, and more to Express applications.

### 5. Express Framework

- **Express.js** is a fast, flexible, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs using JavaScript on the server side.
- Express is an open-source framework developed and maintained by the Node.js Foundation.
- It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing.

### 6. What is a Closure? Any Example

- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
- In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope (i.e., all its variables and functions defined in the outer function) from an inner function.
- In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

```javascript
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

#### 7. Explain Anonymous Function

- An **Anonymous Function** is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
- Normally, we use the `function` keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript.
- However, in anonymous functions, we use only the `function` keyword without the function name.
- An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation; it can only be accessed by a variable in which it is stored as a function value.

**Common uses of Anonymous Functions:**

- **Using `setTimeout`:**

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!");
}, 2000);
```

- **Self executing function:**

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!");
})();
```

- ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous function, which is known as Arrow Functions.
- In an Arrow function, everything remains the same, except here we don’t need the function keyword also.
- Here, we define the function by a single parenthesis and then ‘=>’ followed by the function body.

```javascript
let greet = () => console.log("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!");
greet();
```

#### 8.Callback Function/ Callback Hell

- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument.
- This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function
  function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  }

```javascript
function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
```

- The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language.
- That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
- Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

```javascript
function firstFunction() {
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("First function called");
  }, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
  console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();
Output;
// Second function called
// First function called
```

- As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed.
- So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

- Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic.
- The callback hell looks like below,

```javascript
async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});

```

- You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

```javascript
loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
  console.log("first script is loaded");

  loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
    console.log("second script is loaded");

    loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
      console.log("third script is loaded");
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });
  });
});
```
